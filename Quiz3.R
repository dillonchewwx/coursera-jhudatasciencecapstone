# Quiz 3 - Natural language processing II
# For each of the sentence fragments below, use your natural language processing algorithm to predict the next work in the sentence.

# Use the last three words of the sentence to predict the 4th word based on the quadrigram model. If there are no predictions, then use the last two words with the trigram model, and then last word with the bigram model.

# This very simple approach works about 50-60% of the time. Perhaps a better approach using machine learning should be implemented.
