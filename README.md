This is the repository for the Capstone Project from the [JHU Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project) offered on Coursera. In this project, the goal is to build a predictive model based on text data obtained from the web for text prediction. The deliverables are as follow:

1. [Milestone report](https://dillonchewwx.github.io/coursera-jhudatasciencecapstone/MilestoneReport.html) which describes the features of the training data.
2. [Shiny App](https://dillonchewwx.shinyapps.io/coursera-jhudatasciencecapstone/) which provides a user interface which can be accessed by users. 
3. [Slide deck](https://github.com/dillonchewwx/coursera-jhudatasciencecapstone/Slides.html) documenting the project.
